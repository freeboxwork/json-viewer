                <p>JSON Tools ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard information when you visit our website.</p>

                <h2>Data Processing</h2>
                <p>JSON Tools is a client-side application. <strong>All JSON data you input is processed entirely in your browser.</strong> We do not send, store, or have access to any JSON data you paste, upload, or process using our tools.</p>

                <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
                <p>We may collect the following types of information:</p>

                <h3 style="font-size:1rem;margin-top:16px;">Local Storage</h3>
                <p>We use your browser's Local Storage to save your preferences (such as theme selection). This data is stored locally on your device and is never transmitted to our servers.</p>

                <h3 style="font-size:1rem;margin-top:16px;">Cookies</h3>
                <p>We may use cookies or similar technologies for the following purposes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Essential Cookies:</strong> To remember your preferences (theme, settings).</li>
                    <li><strong>Analytics Cookies:</strong> To understand how visitors use our website (page views, popular tools). This data is anonymized and aggregated.</li>
                    <li><strong>Advertising Cookies:</strong> Third-party advertising services (such as Google AdSense) may use cookies to serve personalized ads based on your browsing history.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Google AdSense</h2>
                <p>We use Google AdSense to display advertisements on our website. Google AdSense may use cookies and web beacons to collect information about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide relevant advertisements.

                <p>You can opt out of personalized advertising by visiting <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads" target="_blank">Google Ads Settings</a>.</p>

                <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
                <p>Our website may use the following third-party services:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Google AdSense</strong> — For displaying advertisements</li>

                </ul>
                <p>Each of these services has their own privacy policies governing how they process data.</p>

                <h2>Data Retention</h2>
                <p>Since we do not collect or store your JSON data, there is no data to retain. Browser-stored preferences (Local Storage) persist until you clear your browser data or manually reset them.</p>
