                <p>Last updated: February 7, 2026</p>
            </div>

            <div class="card" style="padding:28px;">
                <h2 style="margin-top:0;">Introduction</h2>
                <p>JSON Tools ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard information when you visit our website.</p>

                <h2>Data Processing</h2>
                <p>JSON Tools is a client-side application. <strong>All JSON data you input is processed entirely in your browser.</strong> We do not send, store, or have access to any JSON data you paste, upload, or process using our tools.</p>

                <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
                <p>We may collect the following types of information:</p>

                <h3 style="font-size:1rem;margin-top:16px;">Local Storage</h3>
                <p>We use your browser's Local Storage to save your preferences (such as theme selection). This data is stored locally on your device and is never transmitted to our servers.</p>

                <h3 style="font-size:1rem;margin-top:16px;">Cookies</h3>
                <p>We may use cookies or similar technologies for the following purposes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Essential Cookies:</strong> To remember your preferences (theme, settings).</li>
                    <li><strong>Analytics Cookies:</strong> To understand how visitors use our website (page views, popular tools). This data is anonymized and aggregated.</li>
                    <li><strong>Advertising Cookies:</strong> Third-party advertising services (such as Google AdSense) may use cookies to serve personalized ads based on your browsing history.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Google AdSense</h2>
                <p>We use Google AdSense to display advertisements on our website. Google AdSense may use cookies and web beacons to collect information about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide relevant advertisements. You can learn more about Google's advertising policies at <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads" target="_blank">Google Ads Policies</a>.</p>
                <p>You can opt out of personalized advertising by visiting <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads" target="_blank">Google Ads Settings</a>.</p>

                <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
                <p>Our website may use the following third-party services:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Google AdSense</strong> — For displaying advertisements</li>
                    <li><strong>GitHub Pages</strong> — For hosting the website</li>
                    <li><strong>CDN Services</strong> — For loading JavaScript libraries (Papa Parse, js-yaml)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Each of these services has their own privacy policies governing how they process data.</p>

                <h2>Data Retention</h2>
                <p>Since we do not collect or store your JSON data, there is no data to retain. Browser-stored preferences (Local Storage) persist until you clear your browser data or manually reset them.</p>

                <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
                <p>Our service is not directed to children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.</p>

                <h2>Your Rights</h2>
                <p>You have the right to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Clear your browser's Local Storage and cookies at any time</li>
                    <li>Opt out of personalized advertising through your browser settings or Google's ad settings</li>
                    <li>Use browser extensions to block tracking and advertisements</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>International Users (GDPR & CCPA)</h2>
                <p>If you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA), you have additional rights under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), including the right to access, rectify, or delete your personal data. Since JSON Tools does not collect or store personal data on our servers, these rights primarily apply to third-party services (such as Google AdSense) that may process your data through cookies.</p>
                <p>If you are a California resident, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) grants you additional rights regarding your personal information. You have the right to know what personal information is collected, request deletion, and opt out of the sale of personal information. We do not sell personal information.</p>
                <p>To exercise any of these rights with respect to third-party services, please refer to the respective privacy policies linked in the "Third-Party Services" section above, or contact us via our <a href="about.html#feedback">Feedback form</a>.</p>

                <h2>Cookie Consent</h2>
                <p>By using JSON Tools, you consent to the use of cookies as described in this Privacy Policy. You can manage your cookie preferences through your browser settings. Most browsers allow you to block or delete cookies. Please note that disabling cookies may affect the functionality of certain features.</p>

                <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
                <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be posted on this page with an updated revision date. We encourage you to review this policy periodically to stay informed about how we protect your privacy.</p>
